<h1>How special relativity explains the Lorentz Force</h1>
  <p>The following video shows really nicely how special relativity explains magnetism:</p>

<br>
  <p>Now let's try and explain the Lorentz Force of a magnetic field on an electron with special relativity:
   <img src="lorentz.jpg" alt="right_hand_rules" width="100%">
    <p>Imagine a wire that has an electric flow and thus induces a magnetic field. Now we assume a electron in front of the wire, travelling in the opposite direction to the electrons in the wire. 
      Because the velocity of the electron-in-front is is higher relative to the flowing electrons / stationary protons in the wire, the electrons get more length-contracted in the electron-in-front's perspective, and so do the the gaps between them. 
      From the electrons perspective, the wire is now </p>
  <p> negatively</p>
    <p> / </p>
   <p>positively</p>
  <p> charged, and it is 
  <p>pushed away</p>
  <p> / </p>
  <p>pulled towards</p>
  <p> the wire. </p>
   <br>
  <p>Now we can check our result with the conventional right hand rule. As electrons have a negative charge, the electric flow (index) points to the right. Because we are in front of the wire, the middle finger points to the top. The thumb and thus the resulting Lorentz force points away from the wire.<p>
